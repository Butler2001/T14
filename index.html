            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, behold my favorite piece of technology thus far! This Lenovo T14 Generation 1 is what has significantly accelerated my understanding of Linux systems. I was fortunate enough to acquire it from my brother-in-law, who received it as an employee laptop from Carvana. He noticed my growing interest in computers around 2021, while I was working for the family business. He offered it to me for the incredible price of around $80, and the rest, as they say, is history. Installing various operating systems on this machine has provided me with a solid foundation and genuine understanding of what it's all about. Amazing stuff, if you ask me!</p>

            <h4>Rasberry Pi 5 Running Retro Arch  - Details</h4>
            <p>So I have expiremented with the Rasberry Pie for about a year now and have actually got my head around the whole project.
            What I wanted to achieve here was a simple solution to play retro games and also learn along the way. It took trial and error many many months to achieve a framwork I can work with...
             I ended up on a "Lakka" base to make things easy i guess lol all I know is that you intially get your boot media ready and its all ready to go after that.
              so boom just like that i am up in running like a pro playing to my hearts desire : - )  xD     </p>
